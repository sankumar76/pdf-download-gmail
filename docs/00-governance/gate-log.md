## G0 – Intake — 2026-10-29

> Back-filled on 2026-10-29 from Jira [PGD-1 comment 10081](https://sankumar76.atlassian.net/browse/PGD-1?focusedCommentId=10081).
> The original decision could not be written here because of blocker B-01 (write guard), which is now resolved.
> The substance of the decision is unchanged.

- **Decision:** GO
- **Decided by:** master  ·  **Human override:** none
- **Attempt:** 1
- **Artefacts evaluated:** `docs/project-state.md` (Request section, 2026-10-29); `Gmail PDF Attachment Downloader — Requirements.md` (repo root, on `main` at commit 1021f34); `CLAUDE.md` §1, §1a, §9; Jira PGD-1 description

| # | Check | Mandatory | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Problem statement | ✱ | ✅ | `docs/project-state.md` Request L21; PGD-1 description; req doc §1 |
| 2 | Sponsor / decision-maker named | ✱ | ✅ | Santhosh / MD, in project-state L22 and CLAUDE.md §1 |
| 3 | Desired outcome | | ✅ | project-state L23; req doc §6.2 (9 acceptance criteria that can be checked) |
| 4 | Known constraints | | ✅ | project-state L24; req doc §1 tech stack, §2.2 SEC-01..09; CLAUDE.md §9 |
| 5 | Inputs listed | | ✅ | project-state L25; req doc tracked on `main` (commit 1021f34) |
| 6 | Input conflicts resolved (supporting) | | ✅ | Req doc §1 puts the GUI out of scope, but CLAUDE.md §9 requires one: resolved by **D-01**. Key PDG vs PGD: resolved by **D-02** |

**Conditions / remediation**
| # | Owner agent | Artefact | Required change | Due gate |
|---|-------------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| — | — | — | None. The follow-ups below are not conditions. | — |

Follow-ups (not conditions):
- Santhosh: append the D-01/D-02 notes to CLAUDE.md (T-01). *Status 2026-10-29: done. The key correction is in CLAUDE.md §1/§1a as an uncommitted working-copy change.*
- business-analyst: catalogue the SEC/FR/NFR/LOG IDs, add GUI requirements sourced to D-01, and mark req doc §1 "GUI out of scope" as superseded (G1).
- solution-architect: write a UI-framework ADR that justifies the extra dependency (G3).

**Risks registered:** RISK-001, RISK-002, RISK-003, RISK-004, RISK-005, RISK-006 (PGD-1 comment 10082)
**Rationale:** Both mandatory G0 items have evidence: the problem statement and a named sponsor. All supporting items are present. The two conflicts between inputs, GUI scope and the Jira key, were settled by delivery-lead decisions D-01 and D-02 before discovery. G0 is not in `HUMAN_APPROVAL_POINTS`, so no human approval is needed.

## G1 – Discovery — 2026-10-29

- **Decision:** CONDITIONAL GO
- **Decided by:** master  ·  **Human override:** none
- **Attempt:** 1
- **Artefacts evaluated:** `docs/01-discovery/project-brief.md` v0.1, `requirements-catalog.md` v0.1 and `stakeholder-map.md` v0.1 (all at commit ef16e90 on `docs/PGD-1-inception`, no later changes); source `Gmail PDF Attachment Downloader — Requirements.md` (RD); Jira PGD-1 comment 10086 (business-analyst hand-off) and 10087 (brief); `docs/00-governance/*`

| # | Check | Mandatory | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Goals are SMART | ✱ | ✅ | Brief §3 L25-35: GOAL-01..09 each have a metric, baseline, numeric target and a "by when". "By when" is a delivery gate, not a date, because there is no deadline (Q-01, ASSUMPTION-14). GOAL-09 is labelled PROPOSED (see C4) |
| 2 | In / out of scope stated | ✱ | ✅ | Brief §5 L49-70: in scope, out of scope, future consideration. RD §1 "GUI out of scope" is marked superseded by D-01 (L67; catalogue L19) |
| 3 | Stakeholders & personas identified | ✱ | ✅ | `stakeholder-map.md` L6-15 (7 stakeholders, influence/interest, success measure), grid L17-21, RACI L23-36; personas P-01/P-02 (brief §4, catalogue L39) |
| 4 | Requirements catalogue has IDs and sources | ✱ | ✅ | Every row in the catalogue has an ID and a Source column. Master checked by grep: the RD has 37 unique SEC/FR/NFR/LOG IDs and the catalogue has the same 37. Sampled wording of SEC-04, FR-02, FR-13, NFR-01, NFR-05 and LOG-05 matches RD L46, L91, L108, L133, L137 and L145 |
| 5 | Business rules captured | | ✅ | Catalogue L173-189: BR-001..014, each with type, source and exceptions |
| 6 | Open questions have owners | | ✅ | Catalogue L254-268: Q-01..Q-13, each with owner, needed-by and a linked assumption. None blocks G2, so there are rightly no Jira question issues (playbook §4.2) |
| 7 | Assumptions labelled | | ✅ | Catalogue L232-249: ASSUMPTION-01..16, each with impact-if-false and owner; brief §8 |
| 8 | Consistency with governance records (supporting) | | ⚠️ | Brief §10 L115-127 still shows the pre-reassessment scores: RISK-002 P=3, RISK-004 P=3, RISK-006 P=5 ("master to re-assess"). The register now has RISK-002 at 2 (reduced) and RISK-004/006 closed, and proposed risks A/B/C are now RISK-007/008/009 → C1 |
| 9 | Forward readiness for G2 (supporting) | | ⚠️ | (a) G2 requires quantified NFRs, but the RD has no performance target and Q-11 is due only at G3 (catalogue L93, L266) → C3. (b) BRQ-007 (audit trail, LOG-01..05) maps to GOAL-02, whose metric is file naming only, so no goal measures the audit trail (catalogue L32) → C2 |
| 10 | Requirement quality (supporting) | | ✅ | Vague terms were rewritten or flagged (catalogue L278: GUI-18 has a verifiable proxy; the NFR-05 reading is labelled ASSUMPTION-16). Unsourced items are labelled as BA proposals (GUI-19, UR-013, GOAL-09, all MoSCoW per ASSUMPTION-05) |

**Conditions / remediation**
| # | Owner agent | Artefact | Required change | Due gate |
|---|-------------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| C1 | business-analyst | `docs/01-discovery/project-brief.md` §10 | Align the risk table with `risk-register.md`: RISK-002 = 2 (reduced, open until the CLAUDE.md change is committed), RISK-004 closed, RISK-006 closed, and replace PROPOSED-RISK-A/B/C with RISK-007/008/009 and their scores | G2 |
| C2 | product-manager | `docs/02-product/prd.md` (success metrics) | Give BRQ-007 / LOG-01..05 a measurable success metric (e.g. 100 % of runs, including cancelled and failed runs, produce a log and a CSV, with one row per candidate attachment and a valid LOG-03 status), or trace LOG-01..05 to a goal whose metric covers them | G2 |
| C3 | product-manager (Santhosh consulted) | `docs/02-product/prd.md` (NFRs) | Answer the performance part of Q-11 at G2, not G3 (D-03). State a quantified performance NFR (e.g. elapsed time per 1,000 matched messages under the Gmail quota) or record "no performance target" as an explicit Won't with sponsor agreement. Keep NFR-01..05 numeric | G2 |
| C4 | product-manager (Santhosh consulted) | `docs/02-product/prd.md` (success metrics) | Confirm GOAL-09 (dry run in 5 minutes or less from the GUI) with the sponsor and keep it as a success metric, or drop it or mark it Could. It cannot stay PROPOSED in the PRD | G2 |

Follow-ups (not conditions):
- product-manager: decide Q-05, Q-06, Q-09, Q-13 and confirm MoSCoW (ASSUMPTION-05). Q-06 also mitigates RISK-008.
- solution-architect: run a spike on Q-07 (RISK-007); decide Q-08 and Q-11 (memory reading); write the UI-framework ADR (RISK-001).
- Santhosh: answer Q-01, Q-02, Q-04, Q-10 (Q-10 also mitigates RISK-009) before G2 is decided where possible; commit the CLAUDE.md working-copy change (closes RISK-002).

**Risks registered:** RISK-007 (search-recall gap), RISK-008 (manifest loss → duplicates), RISK-009 (downloaded PDFs and logs unprotected on disk). Re-checked: RISK-002 stays reduced and open (CLAUDE.md is still modified and uncommitted at G1); RISK-001, 003 and 005 are unchanged.
**Rationale:** All four mandatory G1 items have file and line evidence. Grep confirmed that all 37 source IDs are catalogued with their original IDs and sources, and sampled wording is faithful to the RD. The conditions are supporting gaps: the brief's risk table is stale, and two things would make the G2 mandatory checks fail if left alone (no quantified performance NFR, no metric for the audit trail). Each condition has an owner and is due at G2. G1 is not in `HUMAN_APPROVAL_POINTS`, so no human approval is needed.

## G2 – Product Definition — 2026-10-29

- **Decision:** CONDITIONAL GO
- **Decided by:** master  ·  **Human override:** none
- **Attempt:** 1
- **Artefacts evaluated:** `docs/02-product/prd.md` v0.1 and `release-plan.md` v0.1 (commit 28589b4 on `docs/PGD-1-inception`, draft PR #1); `docs/01-discovery/project-brief.md` and `requirements-catalog.md` **as committed at 3c3366f**. The business-analyst's uncommitted working-copy edits to `docs/01-discovery/*` were not evaluated. Also: `docs/00-governance/*`, `docs/standards/coding-standards.md`, `definition-of-done.md`, RD (`Gmail PDF Attachment Downloader — Requirements.md`), Jira PGD-1 comments 10090–10093 (briefs, BA C1 hand-off 10091, PM hand-off 10092)

| # | Check | Mandatory | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Every FR traces to a brief goal | ✱ | ✅ | PRD §4: Goal column filled for 66/66 FRs (master scripted check; FR-001..066 all present, no gaps or duplicates). The §11 matrix covers all 66 FRs (master checked the union). GOAL-01..09 keep the brief §3 targets. FR-039..042 and FR-046 trace only to GOAL-10, which the PRD defines as G1 C2 allowed. They also trace through BRQ-007 to brief GOAL-02 (catalogue BRQ-007 row). The brief does not mirror GOAL-10 yet → C5 |
| 2 | NFRs quantified | ✱ | ✅ | PRD §5 NFR-001..025: 24 have numeric targets, and NFR-025 (availability) is an explicit Won't. The performance targets NFR-001..004 are numeric, which satisfies D-03 (e.g. NFR-001: 1,000 messages ≤ 15 min at 300 ms per call). They are labelled PA-01 and await sponsor confirmation (RISK-011, RISK-013) |
| 3 | MVP scope explicit with MoSCoW | ✱ | ✅ | PRD §6.1: MVP = R1 + R2. Master recount: 53 Must (R1 37 + R2 16), 11 Should, 2 Could = 66. §6.2 lists the Won'ts with the consequence of each. §15.2 lists the MoSCoW changes from the catalogue |
| 4 | Success metrics defined | ✱ | ✅ | PRD §3: GOAL-01..10 each have a metric, type, baseline, target and measurement method. Leading indicators are at L61 |
| 5 | Epics outlined | | ✅ | PRD §7: EPIC-01..10 with FRs, release, size and dependencies. Every FR has an owning epic (L354). Points add up to R1 99 + R2 42 = 141 |
| 6 | Release plan present | | ✅ | `release-plan.md` §1–§7: R1/R2/R3/backlog, waves W1–W6 with exit checks, entry and exit criteria, critical path |
| 7 | No contradiction with the brief | | ⚠️ | No conflict of substance. The PRD refines the brief: GOAL-07 excludes timestamps, GOAL-01 adds the PA-04 real-mailbox check, and PD-05 resolves RD "writes nothing" vs AC-09. Gaps: (a) GOAL-10 is not in brief §3 yet; (b) brief §12 has Q-01, Q-02 and Q-10 needed by G2 (owner Santhosh), but PRD §12 moves them to G8 under the labelled assumptions PA-08 and PA-09. The brief's needed-by dates are stale → C5 |
| 8 | G1 C1 closed (brief §10 = register) | | ✅ | Brief §10 at 3c3366f against `risk-register.md`: all nine rows match on P, I, score and status. RISK-002 = 1×2 reduced and open; RISK-004 and 006 closed; RISK-007/008/009 = 12/9/8 with the register owners. PGD-1 c.10091 |
| 9 | G1 C2 closed (audit-trail metric) | | ✅ | PRD §3 GOAL-10 (L59): four checkable sub-metrics, 100 % of runs, 0 discrepancies, hard-kill tolerance ≤ 1. NFR-005; FR-039..043 and FR-046 |
| 10 | G1 C3 closed (performance NFR) | | ✅ | NFR-001..004 are numeric (PD-07), not a Won't. The sponsor was not consulted at G2, and confirmation is deferred to G8 (PRD §14.3 item 1). That is allowed because the condition required either numbers or a Won't agreed with the sponsor. The residual exposure is RISK-011 |
| 11 | G1 C4 closed (GOAL-09) | | ✅ | GOAL-09 is adopted as a Should metric (PD-08) and is no longer PROPOSED. Master verified that every FR tracing to GOAL-09 (FR-006, 044, 047, 060, 065) also traces to another goal |
| 12 | Consistency with standards | | ⚠️ | NFR-022 sets line coverage of `gmail_pdf` at ≥ 85 %. `coding-standards.md` §6 L46 sets 100 % on changed code, and `definition-of-done.md` L9 sets ≥ 90 % on changed code. The PRD does not say which rule governs at G5/G6 → C6 |
| 13 | Scope reductions against the source are logged | | ✅ | RD L65 makes `config.yaml`/`.env` optional. The PRD sets CFG-11 to Won't (§6.2, PD-01, §14.3 item 4), and the GUI-03 paths move to R3. Logged as D-04 and D-13. Every RD ID maps in §15.1 |
| 14 | MoSCoW balance | | ⚠️ | Must is 93 % of MVP effort (PRD §8 L289). The PM recorded this as deviation PD-09 with five mitigations. Accepted as RISK-010 (not a blocker: the Musts are the sponsor's own acceptance contract) |

**Conditions / remediation**
| # | Owner agent | Artefact | Required change | Due gate |
|---|-------------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| C5 | business-analyst | `docs/01-discovery/project-brief.md` §3 and §12; `requirements-catalog.md` | (a) Add GOAL-10 Auditability with the PRD §3 metric and map BRQ-007 to GOAL-02 and GOAL-10. (b) Mark Q-05, Q-06, Q-09, Q-13 and the performance part of Q-11 resolved, citing PD-01..04 and PD-07. (c) Move Q-01, Q-02 and Q-10 to needed-by G8, linked to PA-09 and PA-08 (or have Santhosh answer them). Then commit. This work was already in progress at decision time (PGD-1 c.10093) | G3 |
| C6 | product-manager (with solution-architect test strategy) | `docs/02-product/prd.md` NFR-022 | Make NFR-022 consistent with `coding-standards.md` §6 and the DoD. Either state that ≥ 85 % is a whole-package floor and that per-PR changed-code coverage follows the coding standards, or propose a standards change through master. Editorial fix at the same time: §0 and §15.1 say "FR-039..044" for C2 and BRQ-007, but FR-044 (dry run) is outside GOAL-10. Correct this to FR-039..043, 046 or state the reason | G3 |

Follow-ups (not conditions):
- orchestrator: post the PRD §14.3 sponsor-confirmation list on PGD-1 now as a **non-blocking FYI** @-mentioning Santhosh. The point is to catch objections before the build, not only at G8 (mitigates RISK-011 and RISK-013). This does not add a human approval point.
- solution-architect (G3): PQ-01..03; Q-07 spike against NFR-001/002 (RISK-007); UI-framework ADR with a spike against FR-054..060 (RISK-012); manifest integrity (RISK-008); core API with progress events and cancellation.
- Santhosh: commit the CLAUDE.md working-copy change. It is still modified at G2, so RISK-002 stays open.

**Risks registered:** RISK-010 (Must-heavy MVP), RISK-011 (performance targets not validated), RISK-012 (GUI framework vs §9), RISK-013 (sponsor confirms ten product decisions only at G8). Re-assessed: RISK-001 (trigger avoided by the R1/R2 split), RISK-007 (residual conditionally accepted, PD-06), RISK-008 (behaviour decided, PD-02). Scores unchanged. RISK-002 stays open.
**Rationale:** All four mandatory G2 items have line-level evidence. Master counted the FRs and checked the goal traceability for all 66. All G1 conditions C1–C4 are closed. The two conditions are consistency gaps outside the PRD's mandatory content: the brief does not yet mirror GOAL-10, and the coverage NFR is ambiguous against the standards. Neither puts users, data or correctness at risk before G3, so each has an owner and is due at G3. G2 is not in `HUMAN_APPROVAL_POINTS`, so no human approval is needed.
