> Back-filled on 2026-10-29 from Jira [PGD-1 comment 10081](https://sankumar76.atlassian.net/browse/PGD-1?focusedCommentId=10081).
> The original decision could not be written here because of blocker B-01 (write guard), which is now resolved.
> The substance of the decision is unchanged.

- **Decision:** GO
- **Decided by:** master  ·  **Human override:** none
- **Attempt:** 1
- **Artefacts evaluated:** `docs/project-state.md` (Request section, 2026-10-29); `Gmail PDF Attachment Downloader — Requirements.md` (repo root, on `main` at commit 1021f34); `CLAUDE.md` §1, §1a, §9; Jira PGD-1 description

| # | Check | Mandatory | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Problem statement | ✱ | ✅ | `docs/project-state.md` Request L21; PGD-1 description; req doc §1 |
| 2 | Sponsor / decision-maker named | ✱ | ✅ | Santhosh / MD, in project-state L22 and CLAUDE.md §1 |
| 3 | Desired outcome | | ✅ | project-state L23; req doc §6.2 (9 acceptance criteria that can be checked) |
| 4 | Known constraints | | ✅ | project-state L24; req doc §1 tech stack, §2.2 SEC-01..09; CLAUDE.md §9 |
| 5 | Inputs listed | | ✅ | project-state L25; req doc tracked on `main` (commit 1021f34) |
| 6 | Input conflicts resolved (supporting) | | ✅ | Req doc §1 puts the GUI out of scope, but CLAUDE.md §9 requires one: resolved by **D-01**. Key PDG vs PGD: resolved by **D-02** |

**Conditions / remediation**
| # | Owner agent | Artefact | Required change | Due gate |
|---|-------------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| — | — | — | None. The follow-ups below are not conditions. | — |

Follow-ups (not conditions):
- Santhosh: append the D-01/D-02 notes to CLAUDE.md (T-01). *Status 2026-10-29: done. The key correction is in CLAUDE.md §1/§1a as an uncommitted working-copy change.*
- business-analyst: catalogue the SEC/FR/NFR/LOG IDs, add GUI requirements sourced to D-01, and mark req doc §1 "GUI out of scope" as superseded (G1).
- solution-architect: write a UI-framework ADR that justifies the extra dependency (G3).

**Risks registered:** RISK-001, RISK-002, RISK-003, RISK-004, RISK-005, RISK-006 (PGD-1 comment 10082)
**Rationale:** Both mandatory G0 items have evidence: the problem statement and a named sponsor. All supporting items are present. The two conflicts between inputs, GUI scope and the Jira key, were settled by delivery-lead decisions D-01 and D-02 before discovery. G0 is not in `HUMAN_APPROVAL_POINTS`, so no human approval is needed.
