# restrict-writes.sh — PreToolUse guard for Write/Edit tool calls.
#
# Usage (from agent frontmatter):
#   bash "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/restrict-writes.sh" <allowed-prefix> [...]
#
# Each <allowed-prefix> is a path relative to the project root. A prefix ending in
# "/" allows anything under that directory; otherwise it must match the file exactly.
# Claude Code passes the tool call as JSON on stdin; exit code 2 blocks the call and
# the stderr message is shown to the agent so it can correct itself.
#
# Requires: jq (preferred) or python3. Fails CLOSED if neither is available.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
